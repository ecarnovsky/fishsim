# Fish Sim

Fish Sim is my first ever back-end project. In it users can manage their own virtual fish tank and raise unique fish. I made Fish Sim mainly to gain practice setting up and interacting with databases. Currently Fish Sim uses MongoDB Atlas to store data, but I plan on moving it to a relational database in the future for the faster indexing.
At the moment, Fish Simâ€™s UI has not been coded. My plans are to learn React before I start work on the UI. 

The template I used to help me get started can be found [here](https://github.com/100devs/todo-mvc-auth-local).

## 2/13/2024 Update 
I went ahead and added a fish image generator to the client-side code. It draws a simple image on a canvas element using information from the DB about what the fish should look like. 

### Features I plan to add:
- Ability to upload a profile picture
- Cron jobs that interact with the database
- Discussion forums
- Koi and Bettas
- More realistic guppy color genetics
