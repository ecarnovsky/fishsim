# Fish Sim

Fish Sim is a small simulation website where a user can make an account and care for virtual fish. I made Fish Sim mainly to gain practice setting up and interacting with a database. Fish Sim uses Mongo Atlas to store the database, and Mongoose it used to help with retrieval. 
At the moment, Fish Simâ€™s UI is not coded. My plans are to learn React before I start work on the UI. 

### Features I plan to add:
- Ability to upload a profile picture
- Cron jobs to interact with the database
- Discussion forums
- Koi and Bettas
- More realistic guppy color genetics
